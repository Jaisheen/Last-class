	
Two friends got lost in a forest, they were afraid of animals and also hungry. One of them started crying. They saw a crocodile and a monkey playing, they went near them and wished them good afternoon. The monkey asked them why were they crying and the crocodile got greedy after seeing them and wanted to eat them.
